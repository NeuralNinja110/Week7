## Business Context
Armstrong Oberbrunner and Okuneva is a data-driven customer experience company that helps businesses understand and optimize their customer relationships through advanced analytics. They specialize in creating compelling data visualizations that transform raw customer data into actionable business insights for executive decision-making and strategic planning.

A major retail client has approached Armstrong Oberbrunner and Okuneva to create a correlation matrix heatmap showing relationships between different customer engagement metrics. The client needs a professional, publication-ready visualization that clearly communicates the insights to their executive team and board of directors.

This analysis is critical for the client's upcoming quarterly business review, where they need to present data-driven recommendations for customer engagement patterns. The visualization will be used in executive presentations, board reports, and strategic planning documents.

## Key Insights
